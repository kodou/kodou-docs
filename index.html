        <h2 class="header-light regular-pad">Instant Functions Service</h2>
          <p>The code you want to write today has probably been written 100x already, buried somewhere in your enterprise code base or an opensource repository. Why start a new code design process and subsequent development cycles when the solutions exist somewhere? Using existing code has many advantages over writing new code including time/cost savings, quality, and broader creative options.</p> <p>kodou.io brings amazing advantages. It finds, reveals, and makes usable code buried within applications, and the code is ready (Instant Functions) to run via an API call. The software development workflow is simple:</p>
          <ul>
              <li>Search for code</li>
              <li>Choose a function from the results</li>
              <li>The function is ready to be called via the API.</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>No compiler, editor, dependency management or deployment process.</h4>
          <p>kodou.io is a new workflow without new tools.  The kodou.io service includes the runtime servers for code execution. It can separate corporate and opensource repositories and prioritize as requested. </p>

        <h2 class="header-light regular-pad">Software as a Service + Financial Asset</h2>
        <p class="header-light regular-pad">Software engineers can quickly exploit the kodou.io service for faster product shipping, rapid protoyping of new ideas, expanded software solution options, and higher quality code. They already know how to use this intuitive service. And it enables them to discover and reuse their colleague's software output, and uncover opensource resources.</p>
        <p>Management will bring the view of product time-to-market, financial investments, assets, and budgets. kodou.io also serves as a tool to optimize these financial factors. It reduces the software development cycle which leads to shorter time-to-market. It allows engineers to discover valuable exisiting enterprise software code for reuse, reducing engineering time/cost.</p> <p>kodou.io reveals a huge financial asset that may be missing from the balance sheet, the enterprise's valuable software. The high cost to create and mainatain software is always a part of budgets. It is a big management win to put some of that value on the asset side of financial reports.</p>
